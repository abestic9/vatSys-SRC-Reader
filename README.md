# VATNZ-SRC-Tool
Based in C# The SRC Tool sources the Standard Route Clearances for all eligible aerodromes from the AIP and outputs them into an easy-to-read format, the user has the option to copy them to their clipboard for pasting in one click. Currently The SRC automatically updates the Standard Routes as they are changed by Airways, this is done through our GitHub.

We plan To offer this as a standalone installer for Euroscope Users and pilots alongside a vatSys Plugin, built directly into vatSys.

Inside the Release you will find the Installer aswell as the Plugin for vatSys.
